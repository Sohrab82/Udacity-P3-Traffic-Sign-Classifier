## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, two models, Lenet and a inception like model, have been used to classify traffic signs. [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) has been used to train and validate the models 

The project is done with Tensorflow 2.x and keras. Image augmentation code implemented but not used.
Evaluation of models on a test set shows that an accuracy of 0.9291 and 0.9562 can be achieved with Lenet and Inception models respectively.


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
